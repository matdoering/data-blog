message: "Nice article. These actual 'bioinformatics' degree programs seem new to me and still maybe not super easy to find (I work at Rice University and they don't have one, in fact there are still only a small handful of classes even dedicated to the topic). But, I'm not sure it's a big problem since, as you pointed out, it sounds like it is mostly just taking comp sci classes anyways. With this said, I would just want to re emphasize a couple points on the job market side, which is that if you mostly take CS classes or even just get a more traditional CS degree while taking a few bioinfo classes, then you can probably pick up all or most of the same skills while having all the traditional CS jobs available to you as well. Actually, for anyone interested, I did a podcast episode with the new Dean of Engineering for Rice University (who taught the main bioinformatics course) where he discussed the possible job opportunities here https://anchor.fm/bioinfopod/episodes/Dr--Luay-Nakhleh-What-is-Bioinformatics-ejb05u (hope you don't mind me sharing!). \r\n\r\nSo for those interested, I think if you just pick up all the same core CS skills as folks with a CS degree plus a few of the additional more specialized skills, then you will basically have all the traditional CS job opportunities as well as the more specialized bioinfo opportunities. If, however, you are totally determined to work in the bioinfo field then it is perhaps a bit more complicated as you described in the article. I could see it being slightly more competitive and more skewed towards research etc. But, at the end of the day, if you want it bad enough and work hard enough then basically you can probably do whatever you want in the end :)"
