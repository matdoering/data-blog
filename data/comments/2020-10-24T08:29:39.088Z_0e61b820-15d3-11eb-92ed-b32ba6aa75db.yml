  Hi Matthias, thanks for the great advice. I'm a medical doctor who is
  transitioning to data science. I still want to work with health data and I
  have an offer for a biomedical informatics masters which essentially covers
  parts of bioinformatics and biological data analysis. However, I want to work
  in a big tech company and I get the feeling biomedical informatics isn't
  nearly as respected as computer science. So should I just do a master in
  computer science instead?
