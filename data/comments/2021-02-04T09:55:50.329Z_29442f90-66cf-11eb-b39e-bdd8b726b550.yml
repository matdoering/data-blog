message: "Hi, I am a biology undergrad deciding whether I should take bioinformatics. I do not have a \"stellar\" GPA and of course I never had medical school planned. I initially thought I should do biotechnology but had second thoughts. I too like you have a brother who is studying computer science and therefore do you have any advice on if I should take this field of study? Keep in mind I do not have a lot of coding experience sir.\r\nThank you in advance."
