  Hello Sir, Your article was so informative. I have completed Masters in
  Bioinformatics and got an opportunity to do research as a bioinformatician in
  Agricultural Project from a reputed research institute and at the same time
  got another opportunity to do research in Artificial Intelligence from a
  normal university. As, I have not so much knowledge of computer science but i
  really want to learn new skill. Both places are offering PhD positions also.
  So, what are your suggestions, which position should I opt and which one has
  better future perspectives? I was really stuck between two. Really hoping to
  get a clear decision. Thanks in advance..!
