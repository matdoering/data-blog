  Great article. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I am studying the last
  year of biotechnology in Spain and I have realised that I love programming. If
  you could help me, I have to choose a master's degree in bioinformatics and my
  best options are Ku Leuven, Aarhus, Utrecht university and Freie Universitat
  Berlin. Could you recommend me what is your favourite, it would be very
  helpful to me? Thank you
