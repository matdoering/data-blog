  Hello I just am a bit confused about which subject to study I have got
  admission in Psychology and Bioinformatics. I have done my high school studies
  with Biology as a major. From what i know about myself i am good in Biology
  but i haven't studied math in my highschool which seems a drawback to me. I
  have a keen interest in psychology but the career opportunities are as risky
  for psychology as they are for bioinformatics. To insure a independent life I
  am at the verge of not knowing if I will be able to have a living in
  bioinformatics but due to the vast choices of career paths I have proceeded
  for bioinformatics yet i am not so sure if I am taking the right decision. I
  am writing this message to be guided with strict reality as I would be moving
  to Germany after my BS is completed in either of the field. So kindly guide me
  for my next move.
