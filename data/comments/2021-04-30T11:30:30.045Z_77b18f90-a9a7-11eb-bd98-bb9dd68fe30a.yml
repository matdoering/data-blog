  Thank you very much for this, quite insightful. I’m looking to get an MS in
  BCB, and I have at best high school mathematics. Can you recommend to me where
  and how I can start to take courses in mathematics or computer science that
  would help make my learning easier? I’d appreciate direction. Thank you.
