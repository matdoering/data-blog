  For those who are hosting or planning to host multiple websites using
  WordPress CMS, remembering all the logins or managing multiple websites all at
  once can be a hassle. But the good thing is that there is a <a

  multisite feature embedded in this CMS. Which allows you to manage all your
  websites from a single WP dashboard & network.
